# Wild Card
## Game Description
Wild Card is a game where the player controls a character, moves around the map, and interacts with other characters to progress through the game. The main objective claim the title "The greatest card player of all time" is to defeat four enemies in sequence: Jack, Queen, King, and Joker, each representing a different difficulty level. The game uses poker rules as a reference for progression. The higher the card rank, the harder the enemy and the higher the score target that must be achieved to win the battle. This system reflects how poker ranks determine the strength of a hand, but the gameplay itself is not a poker simulation. 
During gameplay, the player can access an inventory and a shop system. At the current stage of development, come systems function such as the inventory displays collected items, and the shop allows item purchasing, but both are still under development and may be expanded with more detailed mechanics in future iterations. The game concludes once all four enemies have been defeated, marking the completion of the full poker-inspired progression.
